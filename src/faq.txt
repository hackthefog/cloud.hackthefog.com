What is a virtual hackathon?
A virtual hackathon is an online event where high schoolers can attend, learn, program and have fun. It will still have lots of the good stuff a physical hackathon has such as prizes and workshops.
 
What makes Hack the Cloud different from other virtual hackathons?
Hack the Cloud is organized by a team that has experience with organizing hackathons and organized the first ever high school hackathon in San Francisco.
 
What if I don’t know how to code? Can I still attend?
We love beginners at Hack the Cloud! We’ll have a plethora of workshops hosted by coders at several tech companies and startups in the Bay Area where you can learn skills people actually use in the industry. Have an idea but don’t know where to start? Our experienced staff and mentors will help guide you! DM us in the Discord or email us contact@hackthefog.com! 
  
What if I don’t want to submit my hack?
That’s totally fine! You are not obligated to submit anything to attend, this is just an event for you to learn and connect with other high school coders. For example, if you wanted to code something in a group with 5 other people (above the group limit according to the rules), there’s nothing stopping you, you just can’t submit your hack to be judged.
 
What if I don’t have an idea?
We’ll have plenty of resources for you to be inspired, don’t worry if you can’t think of an idea to code when you arrive! Feel free to attend workshops and browse around other tables to see what people are making before you begin. We also have a Hack the Cloud Discord, where you can chat with other people to potentially form groups or share resources and ideas.
 
What are the age limits for Hack the Cloud?
Hack the Cloud is available to all high school students including incoming freshmen and graduating seniors. If you are a middle schooler and want to attend, please email us at contact@hackthefog.com - we will accept you on a case-by-case basis.
 
How do I sign up?
Click the “Register” button on our home page to register on our devpost! You will receive an email once you’ve been accepted, and you’ll get important announcements such as reminders, access to our Discord, and other stuff.
 
I don’t know any other hackers/coders...
Hack the Cloud is a great chance to meet people like you who want to get into tech! Other than our Discord, where you can chat with people who will be attending the event, you can also use Devpost's builtin feature to find people who are looking for a team and connect with them.
 
What are the rules if I want to submit a project?
Hacks must be made by groups of up to four people, no more. Other than pre-made external libraries and tools, the code can only be made during the event. The project must be posted on Devpost before the end of the second day of the hackathon (July 12th 12 am PDT).
Other than the above rules, you’re free to do whatever you want as long as you use common sense - don’t make things that would potentially hurt people in any way. Hack for good!

I have a different question!
Don't be shy, shoot us an email at contact@hackthefog.com!
